## a much simpler way to perform motor control.

the code is based on the berryjam "Spining BLDC(Gimbal) motors at super slooooooow speeds with Arduino and L6234" [here](http://www.berryjam.eu/2015/04/driving-bldc-gimbals-at-super-slow-speeds-with-arduino). 

it still uses Martinez gimbal controller driver boards
